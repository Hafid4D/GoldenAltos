# sfw_sourceControler

The **`sfw_sourceControler`** class is designed for managing the source control functionality within a 4D database environment. It organizes and handles operations related to the source control system, specifically focusing on managing resources, pushing updates, and tracking changes across various files and directories. 

It provides an interface for interacting with the database’s structure and storing relevant data, including reference paths, project files, and resource documents. 

The class ensures that folders and files are correctly initialized, maintained, and updated as needed.

<!--   export() *********************   -->
## .export()

#### Description

The `export()` function is responsible for exporting the necessary files and resources from the database into a structured format. This function likely prepares and packages relevant files, such as documentation, resources, or project-related data, into a destination folder, ready for external use or backup. 

It ensures that the required files are collected and stored in the appropriate locations.

#### Exemple
```4d
$sourceControler:=cs.sfw_sourceControler.new()
$sourceControler.export()
```


<!--   import() *********************   -->
## .import()

#### Description

The `import()` function, on the other hand, handles the reverse operation by importing files or resources into the database. It processes incoming files, ensuring they are placed in the correct directory or integrated into the system. 

The function is responsible for checking the integrity and relevance of the imported files, ensuring that they match the required format and directory structure before being committed into the project environment.

#### Exemple
```4d
$sourceControler:=cs.sfw_sourceControler.new()
$sourceControler.import()
```

Together, these two functions — `export` and `import` — play a crucial role in facilitating the management of resources and updates within a source control system, ensuring that files are consistently backed up, shared, and updated as needed.
